# FHIR Controller Command Line Interface (CLI) Utilities

[![Build Status](https://ci.prestonlee.com/api/badges/preston/fhir-controller-cli/status.svg)](https://ci.prestonlee.com/preston/fhir-controller-cli)

The `fhir-controller` command line utility for interacting with a remote [FHIR Controller]() (or compatible) deployments from an on-premise or cloud host. This cross-platform executable provides:

- Command line interface supplement to a FHIR Controller deployment.
- Ability to upload a directory of Synthea FHIR output directly to a FHIR server in the correct dependency sequence.
- Upload terminology systems (SNOMED CT, LOINC, RxNorm) to FHIR servers as CodeSystem resources.
- "Agent" mode for real-time routing of remote commands to a local Docker engine, swarm, or other orchestration agent.

# Running via Docker Image

```sh
# Get high-level subcommand help.
docker run --rm p3000/fhir-controller-cli:latest help

# Example of headless polling and auto-loading by reference to a FHIR Controller stack.json file.
# Data loading will be triggered whenever the server affirmative confirms the _absense_ of a special AuditEvent import record.
docker run --rm --pull always p3000/fhir-controller-cli:latest poll-auditevent-and-trigger-import http://fhir.example.com/fhir https://stack.foundry.hl7.org/stack.json -i 5

# Example of uploading terminology systems
docker run --rm --pull always p3000/fhir-controller-cli:latest terminology-upload loinc /data/loinc.csv http://fhir.example.com/fhir
docker run --rm --pull always p3000/fhir-controller-cli:latest terminology-upload snomed /data/snomed/ http://fhir.example.com/fhir
docker run --rm --pull always p3000/fhir-controller-cli:latest terminology-upload rxnorm /data/rxnorm.csv http://fhir.example.com/fhir
```

# Terminology Imports

The CLI supports uploading major terminology systems to FHIR servers:

- **SNOMED CT US Edition**: Clinical terminology
- **LOINC**: Laboratory and clinical observations  
- **RxNorm**: Clinical drugs and medications

Start by download the terminology

```sh
# Upload individual terminology systems
fhir-controller terminology-upload snomed /path/to/exracted/snomed/ http://localhost:8080/fhir
fhir-controller terminology-upload loinc /path/to/extracted/loinc/ http://localhost:8080/fhir
fhir-controller terminology-upload rxnorm /path/to/extracted/rxnorm/ http://localhost:8080/fhir
```

# Development & Testing Usage
