The `fhir-controller` command line utility for interacting with a remote [FHIR Controller]() (or compatible) deployments from an on-premise or cloud host. This cross-platform executable provides a:

- Command line interface supplement to a FHIR Controller deployment.
- Ability to upload a directory of Synthea FHIR output directly to a FHIR server in the correct dependency sequence.
- "Agent" mode for real-time routing of remote commands to a local Docker engine, swarm, or other orchestration agent.
